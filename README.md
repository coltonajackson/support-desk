# Support Desk

This is the final project from my React Front To Back 2022 course. Check out the course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/)

---

# Usage

### Clone repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coltonajackson/support-desk.git
```

### Install dependencies for both root directory and 'frontend'

```bash
npm install
cd frontend && npm install
```

### Run dev from root

```bash
cd ..
npm run dev
```

This will run JSON-server on port :5000 and React on port :3000
